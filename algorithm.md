# Algorithm

## Step 1: Define Geofences

1. **Identify Start/End Points**: Define the geographic coordinates that constitute the start and end points of your routes. These points will serve as the centers of your geofences.
2. **Set Geofence Radius**: Determine a suitable radius for each geofence. The radius should be large enough to account for GPS inaccuracies but small enough to provide precise location triggers.

## Step 2: Implement Geofence Detection

1. **Geofence Entry Detection**: When the bus driver starts the app, use the device's GPS to detect when the bus enters the start geofence. This event triggers the beginning of a new route.
2. **Continuous Location Tracking**: Once inside the start geofence, begin sending continuous location updates to your server via MQTT, as you've already implemented.

## Step 3: Route Tracking and Storage

1. **Route Document Creation**: When a new route starts, create a new document in your database to store route data. Include fields like `start_time`, `person_id`, `vehicle_id`, and an array for `coordinates`.
2. **Appending Coordinates**: As location data is received, append the GPS coordinates along with timestamps to the `coordinates` array of the route document.

## Step 4: Detecting Route Completion

1. **Geofence Exit and Re-Entry**: Continuously check if the bus exits the start geofence and re-enters it. Re-entry into the geofence signifies the potential end of the route.
2. **Confirming Route End**: On re-entry, you can either automatically mark the route as completed or implement additional checks (like a time or distance threshold) to confirm the route's completion.

## Step 5: Finalizing the Route

1. **End Time and Metrics**: Once the route is deemed complete, update the route document with `end_time` and other relevant metrics like `average_speed`.
2. **Route Closure**: Mark the route as closed or completed in your database.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **GPS Accuracy**: GPS drift can be an issue. Implement logic to smooth out GPS inaccuracies.
- **Data Volume**: Continuous GPS tracking generates substantial data. Optimize data transmission and storage.
- **Connectivity Issues**: Handle temporary loss of connectivity gracefully, ensuring data isn't lost.
- **Driver Interaction**: Minimal driver interaction is ideal. Automate as much as possible but allow manual overrides in case of anomalies.
- **Testing and Validation**: Test your system extensively under various conditions to ensure reliability.
- **Backend Efficiency**: Your server should handle concurrent data streams efficiently, especially if tracking multiple buses.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Use ML to predict route anomalies or optimize route planning based on historical data.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provide a real-time dashboard for route monitoring and management.
- **Driver Feedback Mechanism**: Allow drivers to report issues or provide feedback on route accuracy.
